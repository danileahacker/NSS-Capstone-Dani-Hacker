<h3 align="center">The Relationship of Bird Populations & Forests</h3>

<h3 align="left">Executive Summary</h3>
Stemming from a love for birding, I would like to explore how the populations of Tennessee-native bird species have fluctuated over the last several years. I will compare areas with high amounts of construction & development/deforestation with areas that are conducive to hosting native bird species, such as state & national parks with heavily wooded areas. I will hone in on any species that have been particularly threatened or whose number of sightings have significantly decreased.

<h3 align="left">Motivation</h3>
Growing up, my father and I bonded over our love for birds. I have been a follower of Cornell University’s Lab of Ornithology for several years & enjoyed their detailed descriptions of bird sightings. I have also been particularly conscious of the effect that the rapid urban development of the greater-Nashville area could have on the native fauna of middle Tennessee.

<h3 align="left">Data Questions</h3>
-	How has the development of forests/deforestation affected the population of native bird species of Middle Tennessee over time? Developments/construction? Is there a relationship between the amount of habitable forest land and the number of sightings?
-	Are there any species that are more present/have a more established population now compared to earlier years?
-	Are there any species that have been influenced more than others? Are there any species that have become particularly scarce/new to the “Sensitive Species” list?
-	Is there any indication that developments/construction have affected species’ migration patterns?
-	Are there any regulations in place that countermeasure the destruction of native bird species’ habitats?
-	Are there any species that have maintained/increased population in urban areas despite deforestation?

<h3 align="left">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>
I plan to present using a walkthrough of an interactive website using Google Sites or a story on Tableau. My presentation will cover top common species & the number of sightings in Nashville over time, both in protected wildlife areas and in heavily-developed urban areas. I plan to explore a few specific species whose populations seem to have dwindled or shifted in location of sightings. I will analyze how available forest land has fluctuated over time and how that may have influenced bird populations. I will end with drawing attention to the need to protect our native bird populations despite the aggressive growth of our city, as well as a short list of ways my audience can enjoy birding & support bird populations in their own backyard. My visualizations will include graphs, interactive maps, and pictures of bird species. My intended audience will vary from those interested in the conservation of middle Tennessee’s native fauna, to the casually interested birder.

<h3 align="left">Known Issues and Challenges</h3>
-	Cornell’s eBird database requires requesting data, specifying by species, date, and location to download manageably sized datasets
-	There is a separate list that must be specifically requested called the “Sensitive Species” list; I have requested access to it, but have not heard back yet.
-	The data from the FIA is in Microsoft Excel format, with an index & several tabs. I need to figure out how to read in the specific sheets that I want to analyze as a data frame.
-	The FIA’s database is massive – it will be a challenge to sift through and figure out exactly what information will be useful to me.
-	The FIA uses its own naming system – Oracle – that I will need to learn the nomenclature & method of organization.
-	I recognize that there will naturally be bias of recorded sightings in places that birders will intentionally go to in order to record sightings – such as parks or forested areas. I will do my best to acknowledge the fluctuation of sightings accordingly.
