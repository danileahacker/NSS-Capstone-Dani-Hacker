<h3 align="center">A Closer Look: Bird Populations & Forest Inventory of Tennessee</h3>

<h3 align="left">Executive Summary</h3>

Stemming from a love for birding, I would like to explore how the populations of Tennessee-native bird species have fluctuated over the last several years. I will compare areas with high amounts of construction & development/deforestation with areas that are conducive to hosting native bird species, such as state & national parks with heavily wooded areas. I will focus on any species that have been particularly threatened or whose number of sightings have significantly decreased.


<h3 align="left">Motivation</h3>

Growing up, my father and I bonded over our love for birds. I have been a follower of Cornell University’s Lab of Ornithology for several years & enjoyed their detailed descriptions of bird sightings. I have also been particularly conscious of the effect that the rapid urban development of the greater-Nashville area could have on the native fauna of middle Tennessee.


<h3 align="left">Data Questions</h3>

-	How have the forests of Tennessee changed over time? How have the forests of Tennessee been influenced by growth and removals of trees?

-	Has the diversity of forests changed in any way? Are there more or less types of tree species growing that may affect bird habitats?

-	Are there any species of birds that are more present/have a more established population now compared to earlier years? Are there any species that have maintained/increased population in urban areas despite deforestation?

-	Are there any species that have been influenced more than others? Are there any species that have become particularly scarce/new to the “Sensitive Species” list?

-	How has the number of bird observers contributed to the number of sightings?


<h3 align="left">Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h3>

I plan to present using a walkthrough of a story on Tableau. My presentation will cover top common species & the number of sightings in Nashville & across Tennessee over time, both in protected wildlife areas and in heavily developed urban areas. I plan to explore a few specific species whose populations seem to have dwindled or shifted in location of sightings. I will analyze how available forest land has fluctuated over time and how that may have influenced bird populations. I will end by drawing attention to the need to protect our native bird populations despite the aggressive growth of our city, as well as a short list of ways my audience can enjoy birding & support bird populations in their own backyard. My visualizations will include graphs, interactive maps, and pictures of bird species. My intended audience will vary from those interested in the conservation of middle Tennessee’s native fauna, to the casually interested birder.


<h3 align="left">Stretch Goals</h3>
As an additional goal given time, I would like to explore the grouping of birds by habitat type. I believe this would lead to further clarity on the types of bird populations that are being most affected by habitat change.


<h3 align="left">Known Issues and Challenges</h3>

-	The number of unique birders in the eBird database has significantly increased over the 10-year period (2007-2016) – I have created a statistic called “birds per birder” that attempts to temper the growing data with the added number of reporters.

-	There is a separate list called the “Sensitive Species” list; it is sensitive information due to protocol to protect the bird populations present on the list & must be excluded from any public posting of this project.

-	I recognize that there will naturally be bias of recorded sightings in places that birders will intentionally go to in order to record sightings – such as parks or forested areas. I have separated the bird sightings according to those found within IBAs (Important Bird Areas) and those outside.

-	The top most common birds are species that can thrive in even heavily urban environments; I have attempted to observe populations of birds that require quieter/more intact habitats in order to thrive. Specifically in Davidson county (which is growing more and more urbanized by the day), I have limited analysis to the 50-75% most common bird populations.
